# Delhi Metro java Project 
This repository contains a simple Java program designed to help commuters navigate the Delhi Metro system. The program allows users to input the name of their source and destination stations, and it then displays the shortest metro route to reach the destination.

## Technologies Used:
Java


## Key Features:

- **Graph and Heap Data Structures:** The metro system is modeled using nodes and edges. Nodes represent metro stations. Edges represent the distances between connected stations.

- **Shortest Path Algorithms:** The program is implemented using Dijkstra algorithm to determine the shortest path between two stations.

## Repository Structure:

- **Main.java:** Contains the core logic and implementation of the metro route finder.

- **Heap.java:** Contains the heap implementation used for efficiently finding the shortest path.
