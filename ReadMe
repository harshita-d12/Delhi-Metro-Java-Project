Delhi Metro java Project 
Our project aims to provide functionalities such as listing stations, displaying the Metro map, finding the shortest distance between two stations, and determining the shortest path with minimum interchanges. 
These requirements are essential for helping users navigate the Delhi Metro system efficiently.
It implements graph data structures to model the Metro network, allowing for efficient route planning using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.
The command-line interface (CLI) is designed to facilitate user interaction, allowing users to input station names or codes and select desired functionalities.
The program is implemented using Java, leveraging features like HashMaps for storing station information and graph representations.
Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm are implemented to find the shortest path between two stations, considering distance. 
The code is structured into methods and classes.
